Fix the code below so a smiley is appended to every item of the list.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Html exposing (..)

things = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

listItem smiley thing =
    li [] [text <| thing ++ " " ++ smiley]

main =
    ul [] (List.map listItem things)
```

**Hint:** XXX laius about currying and partially applied functions.
