Update the code below to have `HELLO` rendered instead of `hello`.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Html

main = Html.text "hello"
```

**Hint:** Look at the String core module, it contains functions to modify the case of strings. Of course you could also update the string directly, but you wouldn't learn much by doing so :)
